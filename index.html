	<h1>Primary school: YinCheng Primary School<h1>
	<h3> YinCheng Primary School is known for its good teachers, beautiful environment and various activities. </h3> 
	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXR27t"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXR27t.jpg" alt="gXR27t.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" /></a>
	<h3> I actually enjoyed a good time there... and the experiences there may probably be the best memories in my life. </h3>
	<h3> I can still remember the days we were having Olympic Mathematics together although this test course is abandoned by NFLS today. Well... it was really a pity for me not to pass that test, but I did have a good time with my classmates. </h3>
    

    <h1>Middle school: Nanjing Jinling Huiwen School</h1>
	<h3> Jinling Huiwen always ranks first in Nanjing's public schools, and it has a lot of good facilities for students and teachers. </h3> 
	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXRWAP"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXRWAP.jpg" alt="gXRWAP.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" style = "float:center"/></a></a>
	<h3> As I failed to pass the entry test to NFLS, I went to Jinling Huiwen School which is near to my home. </h3>
	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXhlff"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXhlff.jpg" alt="gXhlff.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200"style = "float:center"/></a>	
	<h3> These three years in middle school were not that comfortable as my teachers only urgently wanted us to study... but my grade did improve a lot as my teachers were really responsible for us. </h3>
    <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXh3p8"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXh3p8.jpg" alt="gXh3p8.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200"style = "float:center"/></a>
    <h3> I finally succeeded in going to NFLS and continued my dream. </h3>

    <h1>High School: NFLS BCA</h1>
	<h3> NFLS is famous for everything, and it is usually considered the best high school in Nanjing. BCA is also been held for a lot of years. </h3> 
	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gX5uJP"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gX5uJP.jpg" alt="gX5uJP.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" style = "float:center"/></a>
	<h3> These three years have been very complex for me... the events that I have experienced changed me a lot... </h3>
	<h3> For the first year, I underwent a chaotic life. As I first touched a brand new mode of learning and living, I felt too nervous about the atmosphere so I found it hard to balance my studying and life... However, luckily, there were people that liked me and treated me well and I felt warm about that.</h3>
        <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXonv8"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXonv8.jpg" alt="gXonv8.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" style = "float:center"/></a>
	<h3> For the second year, I underwent an exotic life. As I would like to try new things that I have never touched before, I have done a lot of special things like running for the Students' Council or being the vice leader of a club. Although this kind of life was new for me, I spent too much time socializing to keep a good grade. However, I stopped this trend and improved my grade a lot after the midterm exam.</h3>
        <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXo68x"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXo68x.jpg" alt="gXo68x.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" style = "float:center"/></a>
	<h3> For the third year, I underwent a wonderful life. In order to apply for good universities, I tried my best to improve my grades and I finally got a satisfactory result, but this does not mean I only focused on studying. I became the leader of a club and the teacher's assistant in a Science course as well as meeting and making friends with a lot of people. I also got the honour of the BCA citizenship award... It was absolutely the most successful year of the high school.</h3>
        <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gXomgf"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/23/gXomgf.jpg" alt="gXomgf.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" style = "float:center"/></a>
    <h2> Nothing could conclude the three years... but I do want to thank BCA for letting me grow a lot. </h3>
    <h2> Thank you, these excellent years! </h2>
    
	<h1>University: King's College London</h1>
	<h3> King's College London, which is located in the centre of London, has also brought me excellent memories. </h3> 
	<a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPxa5eP"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/09/pPxa5eP.jpg" alt="pPxa5eP.jpg" border="0" width="282" height="200" style = "float:center"/></a>
	<h3> King's College London has beautiful campuses, gentle schoolmates and responsible teachers. Other than studying at King's, I also meet many people who are kind and helpful. I enjoy the life here. </h3>

	<h3> It was indeed a challenge for me to study abroad at the beginning, but as time went on, I got used to life in London and have achieved a balance between study and life.</h3>

    <h2> These university experiences may be the real-time that I live and study on my own. Although I felt it hard in the beginning, the way of getting used to life indeed made me grow up. </h3>
